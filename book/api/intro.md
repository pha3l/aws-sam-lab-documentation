# Part I - Building the API
In this section we will use Typescript to author several Lambda functions, each cooresponding with a RESTful action we want to perform on our data.  We will need basic CRUD actions for creating and managing our polls, as well as an action for casting a vote on a poll.  We will create some simple abstractions that we can use across all of the functions to make dealing with the format of the API Gateway request and expected response easier, and make calls to DynamoDB using the simplified `DocumentClient` interface.  We will also author a CloudFormation template that makes use of the SAM methodology and the transform, and we'll take advantage of the `package` functionality of the CloudFormation CLI, which allows us to use local paths in the template and automatically uploads the referenced files to an S3 bucket that the expanded template can use during deployment.

Using Typescript, while possibly uncomfortable or seemingly over-complicated to those who are well-versed in standard ES6 syntax, has a major benefit when dealing with the often complex AWS Javascript SDK and other unfamiliar packages.  Since comprehensive typings have been provided by the SDK team, IDE autocompletion is a major time saver when navigating an unfamilar API, and one of the main reasons I strongly reccommend using VSCode.  Give it chance before you knock it!
